                            <p style="text-align: center;" data-aos="zoom-out" data-aos-delay="600">Family is very important part of our everyday life. It helps us in improving our personality. It also helps us in shaping our life. It teaches us the value of love, affection, care, truthfulness and self-confidence and provides us tools and suggestions which are necessary to get success in life.

                                Family is a place where you can be yourself. It is a place where you are accepted for what you are. This is where you are completely tension free and everyone is there to help you. Family encourages you when you are surrounded by problems. It helps you survive through tough times and bring joy and happiness into life.
                                
                                Decency is very important in the communication of daily life. It helps us make strong relationship with others and make us come across as a very gentle, intelligent and likable person. Everyone loves to be in a company of such person. Family helps bring decency into our life which is necessary to lead a happy life.
                                
                                One of the most important aims of our life is to build a successful and highly rewarding career. Our families help us in creating a strong future. It gives us valuable suggestion about different career prospective. It not only guides us in choosing the best but also financially helps us to cover the expenses of education. Thus it helps us in making a good future.
                                
                                The importance of family is probably realized when one went to holiday or celebrate an occasion without family members. It was very hard to celebrate an occasion or went to holiday without being surrounded by family members. At that time probably we realize that how important they are to us. At that time, we came to know about the importance of our families.
                                
                                Today, most people don't realize the importance of family. They prefer to spend most of their time with their friends. But when they are surrounded by problems, it was their family that helped them get rid of problems. At the time, when even our best friends refuse to help us, it was our family that came to help us. So it is very important for each and every individual to give importance to their families above anything else and enjoy spending time with family members.

                            <h2 style="text-align: center;" data-aos="zoom-out" data-aos-delay="600">Fill the nature</h2>
                            <p style="text-align: center;" data-aos="zoom-out" data-aos-delay="600">“A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.”
                                “You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,
over the prairies and the deep trees,
the mountains and the rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
are heading home again.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting –
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things.”
“The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quite alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be and that God wishes to see people happy, amidst the simple beauty of nature. As longs as this exists, and it certainly always will, I know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be. And I firmly believe that nature brings solace in all troubles.”
“We need the tonic of wildness...At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be indefinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of nature.”
There is something magical about being in nature. You cannot put it in words, but you feel it deep within – it touches your spirit. Just a few minutes of being in nature makes us feel healed and restored. Nature gives us strength, drains away all negative energy and fills us to the brim with positive energy.

It is little to no wonder that since ages, thousands of cultures and enlightened masters have always encouraged this connection with nature. Buddha for instance left his palace at a very young age to seek liberation in the woods. He even advised his disciples to meditate in the jungle to reach higher states of consciousness.
Most often, it seems to me, we find these things to be beautiful not because of something else they might bring us – a piece of furniture, say, or a ‘delicacy’ to be consumed – but because of the way that the forms of these things immediately strike us upon observation. In fact, one might even think that this experience of beauty is one of the bases for valuing nature – nature is valuable because it is beautiful.

                           <h2 style="text-align: center;" data-aos="zoom-out" data-aos-delay="600">Photography</h2>
                            <p style="text-align: center;" data-aos="zoom-out" data-aos-delay="600">Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.[1]

                                Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.
                                The history of photography began in remote antiquity with the discovery of two critical principles: camera obscura image projection and the observation that some substances are visibly altered by exposure to light. There are no artifacts or descriptions that indicate any attempt to capture images with light sensitive materials prior to the 18th century.

Around 1717, Johann Heinrich Schulze captured cut-out letters on a bottle of a light-sensitive slurry, but he apparently never thought of making the results durable. Around 1800, Thomas Wedgwood made the first reliably documented, although unsuccessful attempt at capturing camera images in permanent form. His experiments did produce detailed photograms, but Wedgwood and his associate Humphry Davy found no way to fix these images.

In the mid-1820s, Nicéphore Niépce first managed to fix an image that was captured with a camera, but at least eight hours or even several days of exposure in the camera were required and the earliest results were very crude. Niépce's associate Louis Daguerre went on to develop the daguerreotype process, the first publicly announced and commercially viable photographic process. The daguerreotype required only minutes of exposure in the camera, and produced clear, finely detailed results. The details were introduced to the world in 1839, a date generally accepted as the birth year of practical photography.[2][3] The metal-based daguerreotype process soon had some competition from the paper-based calotype negative and salt print processes invented by William Henry Fox Talbot and demonstrated in 1839 soon after news about the daguerreotype reached Talbot. Subsequent innovations made photography easier and more versatile. New materials reduced the required camera exposure time from minutes to seconds, and eventually to a small fraction of a second; new photographic media were more economical, sensitive or convenient. Since the 1850s, the collodion process with its glass-based photographic plates combined the high quality known from the Daguerreotype with the multiple print options known from the calotype and was commonly used for decades. Roll films popularized casual use by amateurs. In the mid-20th century, developments made it possible for amateurs to take pictures in natural color as well as in black-and-white.

                            <p style="text-align: center;" data-aos="zoom-out" data-aos-delay="600">Annuity riders have been around for years, but they've grown in popularity over the past decade. Due to market volatility, investors were driven to find annuities that had income guarantees attached to their mutual fund investments. Those attached benefits are called income riders and were originally used as attachments to variable annuities. Today, income riders can be purchased on fixed indexed annuities as well.
                                Most income riders and death benefit riders offer a guaranteed annual growth amount that can be used only for that specific need. For example, an income rider might provide a contractual growth amount of 6% annually as long as you defer for a specific period of time. That 6% growth amount can only be used for income, and the high percentage stops accumulating as soon as you turn on the lifetime income stream. You can’t transfer the amount or peel off the 6% interest like you could with a certificate of deposit, but you can use that amount for income.3﻿

Riders are typically separate calculations within the annuity contract. For example, if an income rider is attached to a deferred annuity, your policy statement will show the accumulation (investment) value, surrender value, and the rider value. All three calculations are different.
here are income riders that solve for lifetime income. Death benefit riders guarantee an annual growth amount that can be used for legacy planning.4

﻿ Long-term care or confinement care riders can be added to help cover the costs of this type of healthcare.5﻿ Usually, there are qualification rules within the annuity rider contract to receive long-term care benefits. Typically, if you cannot perform two or more activities of daily living (ADLs), then you will qualify to receive the long-term care or confinement care rider benefits. ADLs are activities like eating, bathing, and dressing

Automation and creating an app for everything is becoming more important for everyone, from big enterprises to small businesses and even professional and amateur individuals. But extensive knowledge in multiple programming languages has always been a barrier.

As the name suggests, low-code and no-code are software-developing techniques that rely on visual elements to build software, such as dragging and dropping. While you shouldn't expect code-based software to go away anytime soon, low-code and no-code alternatives can drastically cut the time needed to develop an app or software.

It also makes the technology accessible to anyone and everyone with an idea, allowing individuals to design apps, not just whole teams of developers.
